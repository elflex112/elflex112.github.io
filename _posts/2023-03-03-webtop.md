Have you ever thought about running a Linux desktop inside of a container?  Me neither until I found this awesome project from LinuxServer called Webtops.  A webtop is a technology stack that allows you to run Ubuntu or Alpine Linux within a container that is fully accessible from a browser.  This allows you to use most Linux features with a container with a fraction of the cost of resources.  Join me as we configure one from beginning to end.
